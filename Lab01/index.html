                <p>
                    A supplementary Examination is held annually at the end of each academic year and before the start
                    of the
                    next academic year. Supplementary examination is held only for the current level theory subjects.
                    The
                    student enrolled in Summer Term Classes may be allowed to appear the Internal, Sessional and
                    Practical
                    Examinations along with the Theory subjects during the Supplementary Examinations.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The students will only be allowed to appear for their failed papers in the current level subject
                        to a maximum of 50% of the total subjects for the current year rounded off taking together the
                        subjects of both odd and even semester of that year.</li>
                    <li>A student will ordinarily be awarded one Grade less than he/she actually obtains in a subject
                        item in the Supplementary Examination subject to a minimum of C Grade or below, which would
                        remain unchanged. However, there will not be any grade loss for a subject in the supplementary
                        examination for a student, who has attended the summer term classes for those subjects with a
                        minimum of 75% attendance.</li>
                    <li>A student who has been debarred due to attendance criteria in that subject and has not attended
                        summer term classes with minimum of 75% attendance will not allowed to appear at the
                        Supplementary examination.</li>
                    <li>A student, who misses the End semester examination for one/more theory subjects(s) for any
                        genuine reason like medical ailments or mishap in the family, will be allowed to appear those
                        subject(s) in the supplementary examination without reduction in grade. But this will be
                        decided, on a case to case basis, on production of proper documents by the student, subject to
                        the approval of the Vice Chancellor.</li>
                    <li>Students with C or D Grade in any of their theory papers in the current level are also allowed
                        to appear for those papers in the Supplementary Examination subject to maximum number of 3
                        (three) subjects in a year for improvement of their grades without any grade reduction</li>
